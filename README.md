# 👨‍💻 F1ller | Thiago Oliveira

> “Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of intelligent effort.”

🐍 Hey there! I’m Thiago — but in the tech world, you can call me **F1ller**. A gamer at heart and a tech enthusiast by nature, I’ve turned my curiosity into a career. I'm currently working as a **QA Analyst**, ensuring that every feature delivered is tested, reliable, and user-ready.

🎮 Think of me as an avatar in the metaverse of software development — leveling up skills, collecting knowledge, and helping others along the way. Testing, coding, automating, and occasionally breaking things (on purpose) is what I do best.
